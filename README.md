# Project_2_Phonepe_Pulse_EDA

## Phoenpe Pulse Data Geo Visualization Project
## Overview
This project visualizes geographical data from Phoenpe Pulse using a Streamlit application. It provides an interactive map to analyze and understand spatial patterns and trends within the dataset. The data is managed using MySQL.

## Features
- Interactive map visualization
- Multiple layers for different data types
- Customizable map styles
- Filtering and searching capabilities
- Tooltips and detailed information on hover
- Data management with MySQL

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phoenpe-pulse-geo-visualization.git
cd phoenpe-pulse-geo-visualization
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the MySQL database:

Install MySQL on your system if itâ€™s not already installed.
Create a new database for the project.
Run the provided SQL scripts in the sql directory to create the necessary tables and populate them with initial data.
Configure the database connection:
